# Disclaimer

**This one is something from my good old days**

Of course, I would reconsider a lot of things done here :)

This is a simple UDP server, it has even custom logger

# Requirements

- java 8
- initially it wasn't wrapped with gradle, but I added it just to have modern approach and comfortability
- jar includes dependencies, so it's ready to just be used

# Arguments

- specify a port on which UDP server will be running
